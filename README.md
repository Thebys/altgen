## ‚ùì FAQ
### Does this work with non-WordPress sites?
The extension works primarily with WordPress sites, especially for updating alt text. On sites where nobody cared for this so far. However, you can still use it to generate alt text suggestions on any site.

### How secure is my OpenAI API key?
Your API key is stored locally in your browser's extension storage.

### Can I use a different AI model?
Currently, the extension is optimized for OpenAI's GPT-4o, but we're exploring support for additional models in future updates. Feel free to fork this, even submit a PR.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
- Support for additional browsers (Chrome, Edge)
- Batch processing of multiple images
- AI model selection options
- Local model support for privacy
